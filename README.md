# SSHS FIRST Robotics 2021-2022 Team A Code
## `UserControl.java`
`UserControl.java` is our user control, configured for 4WD. At this point in time, our code is NOT factored for an intake system, something which we are configuring. We have a few legacy components include, commented out, in case we feel the need to reuse those components later on.
## The Thing About Auton...
While helping Team B code, I realized that we would need Auton for a variety of different scenarios. If the bot is on blue alliance, it will need to turn right to get to the duck spinner. If the bot is on red alliance, it will need to turn left to turn to the duck spinner. I then remember that we are allowed to place our robot in any orientation **<u>as long as it is touching the wall.</u>** I then made a third auton program labeled `Auton_DW.java` to account for that. The fourth and final scenario is if our alliance partner has a better auton strategy than we do. In that case, our bot will simply charge towards the warehouse and wait for the auton period to end.
**Our auton, at this point in time, is sort of a rough draft. It works, *in theory*. We still need to verify whether it goes the appropriate distance and spins the carousel for the appropriate amount of time, things we cannot verify until we get access to the field.**
